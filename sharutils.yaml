Description: |
    The sharutils package contains the GNU shar utilities, a set of tools
    for encoding and decoding packages of files (in binary or text format)
    in a special plain text format called shell archives (shar).  This
    format can be sent through e-mail (which can be problematic for regular
    binary files).  The shar utility supports a wide range of capabilities
    (compressing, uuencoding, splitting long files for multi-part
    mailings, providing checksums), which make it very flexible at
    creating shar files.  After the files have been sent, the unshar tool
    scans mail messages looking for shar files.  Unshar automatically
    strips off mail headers and introductory text and then unpacks the
    shar files.
    
    Install sharutils if you send binary files through e-mail.
